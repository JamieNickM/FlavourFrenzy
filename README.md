Welcome to the Leader website! For over 20 years, we have been providing quick, easy and delicious meal solutions for busy chefs and home cooks. Our founder, Tony Peterson, established Leader in 1998 with a focus on quality, affordability and great taste. Since then, we have grown to become the largest frozen convenience food business in New Zealand, supplying retail grocery, food service and quick service restaurants throughout New Zealand, Australia and Asia.

At Leader, we specialise in frozen convenience foods and offer a range of products, from classic Kiwi crowd pleasers to gourmet flavours and plant-based options. Whether you're after family-friendly snacks or looking to impress with flavourful finger food, Leader makes it easy to feed a hungry crowd. We also offer meal solutions for tasty, hearty meals that are ready in minutes.

One of our most iconic products is the Toppa - the ultimate hand-held meal on the go. It is famous for its golden crumb and generous filling, making it the perfect combination of flavour and convenience.

Thank you for choosing Leader as your go-to for delicious and convenient meal solutions.
