        <p><b>Chicken Cordon Bleu</b></p>
        <p><b>Chicken Cordon Bleu is a classic French dish that consists of a chicken breast that has been pounded thin,
                stuffed with ham and cheese, then breaded and fried until golden brown. The name "Cordon Bleu"
                translates to "blue ribbon"
                in French and is said to represent the highest level of culinary skill. To make Chicken Cordon Bleu, a
                chicken breast is first
                flattened with a meat mallet, then layered with a slice of ham and a slice of cheese, typically Swiss or
                Gruyere. The chicken
                is then rolled up and secured with toothpicks or string to hold the filling in place. The entire chicken
                breast is then
                dipped in egg, coated in breadcrumbs, and fried in oil until the exterior is crispy and golden brown.
